Thank you very much for grading my homework.

The worst-case run-time of my reverse function will be O(n), which n is the
amount of the data.

The first four lines just set the pointer. Then the main part of reverse
function is the for loop. The for loop will run from i=0 to i=n/2, so the
running time is linear based on n.During each for loop, the function just
change the position of the pointer, so each for loop running time is const
c_1.We need to run n/2 times of this, so the running time is c*(n/2) which is
O(n).For the rest if function, its running time is just constant c_2.
So the total runing time for the reverse function is c_1*(n/2)+c_2 which
is O(n). (Big-O of n).


Thanks for your time.
